# Filters
A working barebones filters app made majorly with Python's OpenCV and Kivy.
Beard, Moustache and Glasses are all transparent background '.png' files that are manipulated to be put onto the face detected in 'filters-app.py'

**NOTE**: I have tweaked the positioning of the images and arguments of the OpenCV 'detectMultiScale' function in order to produce a decent overlay, however anyone is free to tweak them even more.
